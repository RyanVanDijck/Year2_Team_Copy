# Product Demonstration Report

*This section should contain a brief description and demo of product you have built.*

* *Include screenshots (actual screenshots, not mock ups) of all of the facets of the product working.*
* *Link consecutive screenshots together with a brief narrative explaining how the product works, e.g. a sentence "Click on OK and it takes you to the next window", "On starting the app, the following window is shown".  This document should not take you a long time to create - it's just pasting photos and adding explanatory sentences between them, so that your MVP is adequately described.*
* *Make sure an image of each window of your software is included - so that a person who has not seen the actual demo of the product has a good idea of what your product currently does.*
* *If your product is a physical device (a hardware product) then you may replace all of the above screenshots by actual photos/vidoes where you feel it is appropriate.*
* *Make sure this section includes any functionality/features you are particularly proud of.*
* *Indicate clearly which parts of the functionality shown in the screenshots are currently incomplete, and what is likely to change in the final version.  For example if a graph displayed is currently based on static hard-coded data for the MVP, but in the future version the graph will dynamically change depending on fresh data, then point this out explicitly.*
