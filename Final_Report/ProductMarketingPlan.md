# Product Marketing Plan


## Customers

The demographic that is likely to use our product Scanalyzer, are teachers/lecturers in large organisations such as schools or universities. 
This is because we have predominanly catered this program to analyse large data sets, and produce useful conclusions in a report format for the user.
Our target audience may benefit from the program outputs, as they can view things such as average and standard deviation to possibly deduce how well a class might be doing in
comparison to previous years.

## Economics

With reference to the statista and BESA stats pages, there are 4188 secondary schools, and 142 universities in the UK currently.These organisations 
would be our target market.

BESA - https://www.besa.org.uk/key-uk-education-statistics/
STATISTA - https://www.statista.com/statistics/915603/universities-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/

Finding an accurate source for the global statical analysis software market was very difficult, overall, there was only one valid source that could have been used, however paid
access to this document was required. Therefore the stats for this section had to be taken from a much bigger and more competitve market, this being the software and services 
sector.

The current size of the global business software and services market size was valued at USD 322.91 billion in 2018, additionally it is expected to grow by 10.7% by 2025 according
to GVR, this can be deduced that demand is ever increasing for these type products.

Being fairly ambitious, our company would like to attain a 0.002% market share over a 10 year period, this is because from our market reasearch we felt that the product we were
developing was fairly niche, hence if we were able to deliver, we could secure a larger portion, than other starting companies.


## Competition

There a very few tools for sale on the market currently that are classed as 'Student marks analyzer' and, most of these are from free online sources such as git hub,
however there are a larger amount of competitors in the 'Gradebook Software' category. We feel that although software such as excel can perform a similar function,
our software is much more appropirate for the specific purpose of measuring attainment in schools and university. 


### Competitors

Genuine Infotech - https://download.cnet.com/Students-Mark-Analysis-Rank-Card-Software/3000-2064_4-10865115.html

This product is very similar to the program we are devloping, however we plan to compete as its extremely outdated being made for opertaing systems such as
Windows 98/2000/XP/2003 Server/Vista.

Gradebook Software - https://www.capterra.com/gradebook-software/

A list of a other competitors, competition is availble for use as our program plans to be more bespoke for analyzing marks and simplicity only. 

## Product, Price, Promotion, Place

### Product

Our product that we have developed as Team 21, is called Scanalyzer.

Scanalyzer is a statistical analysis tool, developed specifcally for organistations such as univeristies and schools. This is a program developed
specifically for the general lecturer/teacher at mind, and focuses on simplicity. 

### Place

Distribution of our product, will be through a few online vendors such as Amazon and Capterra, additionally, we will have a website availble where customers can buy from us directly

Our team would also plan to attend trade fairs such as IT Showcase london, and CLOUD & DEVOPS WORLD 2020, whereby we can further promote our product, network with customers and
offer exclusive package deals.


### Promotion

In terms of adverisement, we felt youtube and google ads would be viable options, this is because they offer an affordable price based on people actually viewing it rather
than a pre paid fixed price such as a billboard or bus stop ad, furthurmore online advertisments have the benefit of reaching a larger audience due to the fact the internet
has 3.4 billion daily users worldwide.

Generally, for a 5 second video that we could run as an ad before certain videos, it would
cost between $0.10-$0.30 per view, hence if around 100 people watched our ads, it would cost around $20. Additionally, google banner ads (Adwords) would cost around $2.32 
per click on the search network.

### Price

New customers will be able to have a free trial of the software for 7 days.

The cost of Scanalyzer, will be £45 for a single permanent download key and  one month subcription will cost £13.

We chose to set a fairly low price, in order to enter the easily market and build up a good rapport.

In comparison with one of our main competitors, this sale price outcompetes Genuine Infotech's product by almost £343.


## Sales Forecast

Our sales forcasts, sits around a minimum 200 downloads for the year. This is a pure estimation, due to the lack of statistical data in our selling market.

If the forcast is met this means that 1% of our target market has been sold to, this would mean that 43 school/universites in the UK would have at least 6 copies scanalizer availble to use.

The amount of cash acumillated in one year, selling 200 units will be £9000.
