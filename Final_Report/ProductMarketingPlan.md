## Customers

The demographic that is likely to purchase our product Scanalyzer, are teachers/lecturers in large organisations such as schools or universities. 
This is because we have predominanly catered this program to analyse large data sets, and produce useful conclusions to
the user.

## Economics

With reference to the statista and BESA stats pages, there are 4188 secondary schools, and 142 universities in the UK currently.These organisations 
would be our target market.

Being fairly ambitious, our company would like to attain a 5% market share, this is because from our market reasearch we felt that the product we were
developing was fairly niche, hence if we were able to deliver, we could secure this large portion.
