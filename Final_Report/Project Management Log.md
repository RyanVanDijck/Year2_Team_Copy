# Project Management Log

## Project Management Discussion 

Generally, we have been able to work successfully and collaboratively to create a project which reaches the goals that we set out to achieve, and produce a piece of software which works to a decent standard and is of decent quality. 

One of our biggest strengths has been that we have been able to effiectively communicate. This has meant that we have had a clear vision of what functions we want the software to be able to perform. We have also been able to be organised in terms of meeting deadlines. 

Another strength that we have had is that we have been able to use version control software effectively. This has meant that we have been able to work on code without getting in each others way, make expermintal changes that are not permanent and work together to solve problems. One example of this in the program was calculating statistics, where we were able to build in the initial code that someone had written to add more reliablity, stability and accessabilty to the code.<br>

<br>However, there have certainly been aspects which could have been handled better. 

One issue in particular is that the program in some places has been built using some poor coding practices. This has made it diffcult to be able to make changes, fixes and add features efficiently due to a lack of a proper organisation structure. This issue has appeared because of a lack of organisation amongst the team. We should have used the organisational tools available to ensure that we had a clear idea of what the structure of the program before we began writing the program.  

Another issue that we have had regards the use of jira. During the module, we were learning how to effectively use jira to organise ourselves and some mistakes were made along the way. This means that some of our burndown charts do not accurately reflect the amount of work we have actually completed.
