![Running the Application](MVP/Demonstration_Images/Application.JPG)

When the application runs the GUI and its features are loaded. A text area is shown in the bottom right and a dropdown box to the left. Currently these don't have any functionality but can be used in future functionality of the program. e.g. the dropdown could select a particular module to look at which could be displayed in the text area.
The most important feature is the choose file button which will run a file chooser when pressed.
