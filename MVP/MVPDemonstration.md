# MVP Demonstration

![Running the Application]

When the application runs the GUI and its features are loaded. A text area is shown in the bottom right and a dropdown box to the left. Currently these don't have any functionality but can be used in future functionality of the program. e.g. the dropdown could select a particular module to look at which could be displayed in the text area.
The most important feature is the choose file button which will run a file chooser when pressed.

![Pressing the Choose File Button]

Afer the button is pressed the file chooser is loaded to choose the student data file.

![Selecting the Data]

After the correct file has been selected the contents are shown in a table at the top of the program
