## Project management discussion 

As a team, we have generally been able to work together effectively. We have had a normally unified idea of what the project should look like and been able to make steady progress on the creation of the Minimum Viable Project(MVP). We have also work collabratively to keep our jira updated frequently so it is a good reflection of the work that has been completed. 

As it has been a busy period in terms of work needing to be completed for other modules, we have unfortunately been unable to keep up with all of the tasks that we have been assigned during sprints. We also should have probably reported more regarding the contents of out scrum meetings. There has also been some confusion amongst the team due to team members who have not shown up, particularly one team member who has made some edits on GitLab without attending any lab session.
