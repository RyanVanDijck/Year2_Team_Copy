# Project Management log   
## Project management discussion 

As a team, we have generally been able to work together effectively. We have had a normally unified idea of what the project should look like and been able to make steady progress on the creation of the Minimum Viable Project(MVP). We have also work collabratively to keep our jira updated frequently so it is a good reflection of the work that has been completed. 

As it has been a busy period in terms of work needing to be completed for other modules, we have unfortunately been unable to keep up with all of the tasks that we have been assigned during sprints. We also should have probably reported more regarding the contents of out scrum meetings. There has also been some confusion amongst the team due to team members who have not shown up, particularly one team member who has made some edits on GitLab without attending any lab session.

## Burndown chart discussion 

 ### Weeks 2 and 3 
 Unfortunately, little work was completed in the first couple of weeks. What work was done was not updated on Jira. This was reflected in the burndown chart where the red line does not change on the y axis. This was mainly because we needed to relearn how to use the Jira software and because of the fact that we were unclear of what was needed to start the task. 

 We should have probably had a clearer discussion of what needed to be done and set less ambitious tasks and stories. 

### Week 4 
 
In Week 4, we were able to complete more of our tasks, although not all of the tasks in the sprint. The completion of the tasks was also steady, with the shape of the redline dropping at a somewhat consistant rate. 

 This was better as we had a clearer idea of what needed to be created. One issue we had was that we had set tasks to team members who have not yet attended any lab sessions. This means that not all of out tasks could have been completed. 

### Week 5 

In week 5, we unfortuantely had a dip in form as not many tasks were completed or reported. This was likely due to an increase in workload from other modules in this moment of time. Tasks that were completed were completed early on barring one task which was assigned and completed at the end of the sprint. 

### Week 6 

In week 6, all tasks were completed. However, all tasks were logged at the end of the sprint. This was poor as it gives little notification of when work was actually completed and how long it took to complete. 

This work was likely completed beforehand but members of the team forgot to log work on jira. In the future, we need to consider better use of the jira software and its features. 

### Week 7

In week 7, a team member unfortunately forgot to give the stories story points. This has created an unreliable graph, with no useful guideline. However, it can still be seen that few tasks were completed. 

This can be put down to the fact that it was a busy period as well as the continued trend of team members forgetting to keep jira tasks updated consistently.
