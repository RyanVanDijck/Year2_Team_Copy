# MVP Risk Log And Requirements


## Introduction

The purpose of this program, is to read and analyse Student data from previous years and produce an output that can comfortably read by the Education Committee.

## Requirements

### User Stories

As [user] a member of the the education committee, [task] I would like to view the average results of the application programming module, [goal] to view if the
difficulty of the module is easy, hard or adaquate.

As [user] a lecturer of C++, [task] I would like to check if there is a correlation of preformance between C++ and application programming, [goal] to evaluate if students that are strong
in java programming should be encouraged to choose C++.

As [user] a personal tutor, I would like to identify students that low scores across all their modules, [goal] so that I can find out why their scores are low, and what I can do to help.

As [user] the head of the computer sceince school, I would like to know students that are preforming eceptionally well across all their modules, [goal] so that they can be added to the deans list

- Read files presented by the user (CSV spreasheet)
- Generate a report that the user can easily read
- Show statistical analysis of students and modules preformance
    - Viewing the rank of strongest/ weakest Student within each module/all modules
    - indication of modules that appear too easy/too hard
- graphical representation of student and module preformance

### Non Functional Requirements

How well the program will function:

- Clear spacing layout between statistical data and graphs
- Input validation on GUI fields
- Use of dropdown menus, and check boxes to limit input error
- Clear spacing between input fields on GUI
- Clean and attrictive colour palette use on GUI
- Pop up messages upon errors, with guidance messages.


## Risk Log

### Risk 1

Risk: Unplanned work that must be accomidated for

Occurance Likelihood: Low

Risk Impact: High

Risk: Project is incomplete

Occurance Likelihood: Low

Risk Impact: High

Risk Manager: Ryan Van Djick

Mitigating Action: Ensuring all members know when the project is due, and that work is spread across

### Risk 4

Risk: Lack of communication, causing confusion amongst team members

Occurance Likelihood: Medium

Risk Impact: Medium

Risk Manager: Lewis Colley
